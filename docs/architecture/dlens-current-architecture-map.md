# DLens Current Architecture Map (v0.4 — honest status)

> Last updated: 2026-06-12 · Baseline code: `main` after pipeline spine Slice 4 / PR #24 @ `9fb3f30` (0.1.33). This RECONCILE slice adds a tested request reconciler, UI stale-result ignore for Compare/Product/Folder/PR async writes, and a narrow session-scoped snapshot guard; `RECONCILE` is 🟡, not 🟩, because storage-seam-wide stale write rejection is still pending.
> **This is the agent handoff map.** Any Codex / ChatGPT / Claude session reads this FIRST. It is the single source of truth for "what is built, what is enforced, what you must not bypass." Status colors must be kept honest (see DoD rule below) — a stale map is worse than none.

## Legend

```
🟩 LOCKED   — built + a type/test/boundary guard; a regression turns it red
🟢 BUILT    — built and in use, but NOT fully regression-locked yet
🟡 PARTIAL  — partial implementation; still has race / trace / seam / DOM / timeout risk
🔴 NOT BUILT / NOT FIXED — not built, not fixed, or not trustworthy enough to rely on
⚪ EXTERNAL — outside the extension repo's direct control
```

Conservative truth today: **most nodes are 🟢 / 🟡, almost none are 🟩.** That is exactly why roadmap Track A1 (boundary/architecture tests) comes first — it converts status from *claim* to *guarantee*.

## How to read it

- **🟢 ≠ 🟩.** Green = built; only LOCKED = a failing test guards it. Do not claim "won't regress" for a 🟢 node.
- **`Background Worker` is the MV3 service worker, NOT the backend.** Crawl / thread read model live in the `:8000` backend process (separate private repo). LLM calls go directly from the extension to ⚪ external APIs (manifest host_permissions). Three compute sites: extension SW · backend `:8000` · external LLM.
- **Solid arrows = product data flow. Dashed arrows = async / trace / invalidation / external** — the dashed edges are where loading/stale/timeout bugs live.

## Repo residency + DoD rule (what keeps this map honest)

This file lives at `docs/architecture/dlens-current-architecture-map.md`. Every slice/PR DoD includes:

```
- typecheck passes
- targeted tests pass
- full tests pass
- build passes
- architecture map updated if any node/edge status changed
- no 🟢/🟩 (built/locked) claim unless a failing test would catch the regression
```

> If this PR changes a boundary, data flow, async path, storage seam, backend job path, LLM call path, or ViewModel/View responsibility — update this map and change the status color **honestly**. A merged PR that leaves the map stale makes the next agent work on a false premise.

## Roadmap — two parallel tracks (do NOT finish A before starting B)

### Track A — Infrastructure hardening (status: claim → guarantee)

- **A1. Boundary / architecture tests** → 🟢→🟩. View ⊅ `sendExtensionMessage`/`Date.now`/`Math.random`/storage mutation; ViewModel ⊅ `chrome`/`fetch`/DOM/`File`/React; storage write ⊅ bypass seam. *(Do first — it's what makes green mean protected.)*
- **A2. Storage schema version + migration** → `MIGRATE` 🔴→🟡/🟩. `CURRENT_STORAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, migration registry, non-destructive migration, legacy fixture tests.
- **A3. requestId reconcile / stale-result ignore** → `RECONCILE` 🟡→🟩. Async command carries `requestId`; backend/LLM late result must match current target; stale result ignored, not written. This slice adds `src/state/request-reconcile.ts`, UI-shell guards for Compare/Product/Folder/PR Evidence async responses, a narrow session-scoped snapshot guard in `sendAndSync`, and tests that reject stale / target-mismatched responses. Do not mark `RECONCILE` 🟩 until background/storage seam writes are protected consistently.
- **A4. Invalidation / rehydrate contract** → `INVALIDATE` 🟡→🟩. Storage write triggers state update; popup rehydrates deterministically; no infinite loading after write.
- **A5. Backend + direct LLM trace integration** → `TRACE` 🟡→🟩. Trace backend polling + direct LLM calls; record timeout / fallback / provider / provenance. PR #21 typed the event stream; PR #22 threads requestId through collect/capture trace paths; Slice 3 wires terminal VM `ui.ready` events; Slice 4 adds a typed summarizer and `ui.ready` harness gate. Keep `TRACE` 🟡 until backend / direct LLM trace paths are integrated and a real live trace artifact passes the terminal gate.

### Track B — Product quality / analysis credibility (the user-felt value — run parallel, do NOT defer behind A)

- **B1. Backend OP / reply read model fix** → `READMODEL_BACKEND` 🔴→🟡. Fix duplicate-root; fix OP-continuation vs discussion-reply split; preserve parent/child reply relationship; expose clean thread structure. *This is core DLens value, not UI polish or feature creep.*
- **B2. Extension projection alignment** → `captured-post.ts` consumes a documented backend read-model contract (classify OP/reply/continuation from backend-provided structure, not extension guessing).
- **B3. Golden fixtures for thread structure** → make OP/reply bugs testable: duplicate-root, OP-continuation, discussion-reply, nested-reply, quote/repost-ambiguity cases.

**Real priority:** `A1 first → B1 in parallel → A2/A3/A4/A5 continue.` Do not let "architecture perfect" gate "analysis credible." The product value is reading Threads discussion structure accurately, preserving the evidence chain, and producing trustworthy analysis — the VM/seam/trace layers exist to let that grow stably.

## Agent handoff rules (read before any PR)

1. Don't treat 🟢 as 🟩 (built ≠ regression-locked).
2. Don't treat 🔴 as built — it's not there / not trustworthy.
3. Don't add features by bypassing ViewModel / typed command target / storage seam / pipeline trace.
4. Any PR touching an async path must account for `requestId`, target reconciliation, invalidation, and rehydrate.
5. Any PR touching backend analysis must check the OP/reply read-model status (currently 🔴).
6. After merge, if any node/edge status changed, update this map (DoD rule above).
